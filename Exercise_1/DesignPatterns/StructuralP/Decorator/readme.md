Intro:
This project demonstrates how to add extra features to objects dynamically, without changing their base structure.

Core Idea:
Use decorators like CheeseDecorator and OlivesDecorator to enhance a basic pizza with additional toppings. Each decorator wraps the original pizza object to extend its behavior.

Folder/Class Purpose:

Pizza → base interface for all pizzas

BasicPizza → simple pizza implementation

CheeseDecorator, OlivesDecorator → add extra toppings dynamically

Main → demonstrates creating a pizza with multiple decorators

Design Principle Used:
Decorator Pattern – adds responsibilities to objects dynamically while keeping the base class unchanged.
